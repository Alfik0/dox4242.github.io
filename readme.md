# royal-advisory-board

This is an archived copy of Royal Advisory Board, a collection of tools for the game Realm Grinder. I am no longer developing these tools, am no longer playing Realm Grinder, and am disgusted by the behavior of Divine Games. These tools are licensed MIT and as such, anyone is free to clone this repository and update them to work with the current version of the save format. I will not be doing this. Due to repeated requests to fix them despite my reiterating that I am no longer developing these tools and a pull request is the best way to get them fixed, I have taken down the live versions to remove any appearance that I am still maintaining these tools. I apologize for any inconvenience.
