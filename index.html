        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </div>

      <p>Welcome! This is a collection of tools for the incremental game <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/divinegames/realm-grinder">Realm Grinder</a> by <a href="http://www.divinegames.it/">Divine Games</a>.</p>

      <div class="page-header">
        <h2>Tools</h2>
      </div>

      <p><a href="rws/index.html">Realm Weather Service</a> is a forecasting tool for Lightning Strike. It extracts the RNG state from a provided save file and predicts the future pattern of strikes.</p>

      <p><a href="ocd/index.html">Obsessive Conjurer Disorder</a> is a contingency autocasting fine tuner that lets you set your threshold to any number you like.</p>

      <p><a href="rs/index.html">Royal Scribe</a> is a stats utility that shows a variety of stats that can be extracted from save files, many of which are not displayed in-game.</p>

        <div class="panel-heading">2015-11-04 Update</div>
        <p>In my discussion with Divine Games, they cited preventing cheating and preventing theft and rehosting of the game as reasons for obfuscation. In the course of our discussion, it became clear that we have a philosophical difference: I don't think that preventing cheating in a single-player is desirable or a worthwhile use of time, and they do. We agree, however, that the game should not be stolen and rehosted. However, these issues are irrelevant, because obfuscation does not help accomplish either goal. I pointed this out, and they didn't offer a substantial refutation of any technical point I raised, and even claimed that obfuscation helped prevent cheating with tools like <a href="http://www.cheatengine.org/">Cheat Engine</a>, which is patently false. Cheat Engine is exactly as easy to use now as it was before, as is save editing. I know this because I have done both in the post- and pre-obfuscated versions, unlike Divine Games, apparently. In light of the fact that they are either not telling me the real reason they've done this or they do not care about the truth of this matter, I all but gave up Realm Grinder for a while.</p>
        <p>Then I realized that I don't need them to solve this problem. Deobfuscating something sounded fun too, so I did. A lovely free and open-source utility, <a href="https://www.free-decompiler.com/flash/download/">FFDec</a>, did most of the work, and a few hours of writing python gave me a nice set of tools to help make it even more readable. I plan to make these tools more robust to allow for quick automatic generation of deobfuscation maps for future versions, and I will consider making these tools available. People who steal and rehost games do not need deobfuscated code to do what they do, but even if they did, they would presumably already have done much of this work. So here's the question: if I can solve this problem in a matter of hours on my first attempt deobfuscating actionscript using only freely available utilities and writing code from scratch, would it really hinder someone who steals games for a living? Sadly, all obfuscation does is frustrate third-party contribution.</p>
        <p>I'm returning to developing RAB, and I have decided to take the opportunity to learn <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> while I make this site look less like it was developed by a programmer with almost no web design experience. Or maybe more like that. Who knows.</p>

        <div class="panel-heading">2015-10-29 Message</div>
        <p>The 1.4.37 update has greatly increased the obfuscation of Realm grinder's code, leading to me having to read stuff like this <code>if (4P.`@(0;.id)){</code> rather than stuff like this: <code>if (Game.hasUpgrade("Angelic Determination")){</code> for things like extracting formulas for the wiki, reporting bugs to Divine Games, and developing tools like these. This obfuscation has made these tasks much less pleasant, and with me being on the long slog to R16 when the update hit, spoiled my plan to kill time while I waited. I have asked Divine Games about this change and possible solutions, but as things are now, it is unlikely I will maintain Realm Weather Service, write any further tools, or continue editing the wiki. I will update this page if I get any further information.</p>

        <h2>Other Things</h2>
      </div>

      <p>Everything here is open source and licensed MIT, here's the <a href="https://github.com/nyanlathotep/royal-advisory-board">source code</a>.</p>

      <p>These tools use libraries by various lovely people and/or corporations, namely <a href="https://github.com/imaya/zlib.js">zlib.js</a>, <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.<!--, and <a href="https://angularjs.org">Angular.js</a>.--></p>

      <p> I have also written some simple libraries as part of this project, which you might find useful if you are a codey sort.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><b>pmprng</b> is a port of realm grinder's RNG with some extra helper functions for the various upgrades and spells with dedicated RNG instances, like lightning strike. There are <a href="py/pmprng.py">python</a> and <a href="lib/pmprng.js">javascript</a> implementations.</li>
          <li><b>savecodec</b> is a library that converts between exported saves and objects/dicts. There are <a href="py/savecodec.py">python</a> and <a href="lib/savecodec.js">javascript</a> implementations.</li>
      </ul>
