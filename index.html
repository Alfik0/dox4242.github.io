    <p>Welcome! This is a collection of tools for the incremental game <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/divinegames/realm-grinder">Realm Grinder</a> by <a href="http://www.divinegames.it/">Divine Games</a>.</p>

    <p>As of 2015-10-29, the 1.4.37 update has greatly increased the obfuscation of Realm grinder's code, leading to me having to read stuff like this:</p>
    <p><code>if (4P.`@(0;.id)){</code></p>
    <p>rather than stuff like this:</p>
    <p><code>if (Game.hasUpgrade("Angelic Determination")){</code></p>
    <p>for things like extracting formulas for the wiki, reporting bugs to Divine Games, and developing tools like these. This obfuscation has made these tasks much less pleasant, and with me being on the long slog to R16 when the update hit, spoiled my plan to kill time while I waited. I have asked Divine Games about this change and possible solutions, but as things are now, it is unlikely I will maintain Realm Weather Service, write any further tools, or continue editing the wiki. I will update this page if I get any further information.</p>

    <p>At present and perhaps indefinitely, the only tool here is:</p>

    <p><a href="rws/index.html">Realm Weather Service</a> is a forecasting tool for Lightning Strike. It extracts the RNG state from a provided save file and predicts the future pattern of strikes.</p>
